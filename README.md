## 🔍 Overview

This project performs end-to-end churn analysis through:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations to identify churn patterns
- (Optional) Machine learning model integration
- Business insights for customer retention

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains customer-level information such as:

- Demographics
- Account info
- Subscription details
- Tenure and billing data

## 📊 Visualizations

### 🥧 Churn Distribution Pie Chart

Visualizes the proportion of churned vs retained customers, giving a quick overview of churn rate.

### 📈 Tenure-Based Histogram

Shows that customers with shorter tenures are more likely to churn, suggesting dissatisfaction or onboarding gaps.

### 📦 Box Plot: Churn vs Monthly Charges

Reveals whether high monthly charges contribute to increased churn.

### 🔥 Correlation Heatmap

Highlights relationships between features like tenure, contract type, monthly charges, and churn.
